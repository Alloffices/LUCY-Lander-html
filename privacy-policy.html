                <h2>Last Updated: 06/05/2016</h2>
                <p>AutoEntry is a data capture service provided by OCREX Ltd. By visiting our site and using our services, you are accepting the practices and guidelines set out in this document.</p>
                <p>Please note that the practices of the OCREX group of companies (“OCREX”), with respect to data collected and used by OCREX in connection with this website (the “Site”) and OCREX products and services available or enabled via the Site (“Products and Services”), are governed by this online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) as amended from time to time, and not the privacy policy in effect at the time the data was collected. The Privacy Policy will address how OCREX (referring to OCREX and all its services and products) uses and stores the data gathered when you (the ‘User’) use its website.If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us here:</p>
                <p>Email: <a href="mailto:info@ocrex.com">info@ocrex.com</a></p>
                <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+353 1 9022618">+353 1 9022618</a></p>
                <p>Address: 76 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, D02 NY76, Ireland</p>
                <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
                <p>As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Products and Services, OCREX may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, OCREX may ask that you provide certain personal information (as well as certain non-personal information that may be tied to personal information), such as your first and last name, mailing address, country of residence, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, and telephone and facsimile numbers.</p>
                <p>When ordering Products and Services via the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number and billing information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.</p>
                <p>If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Similarly, if you wish to delete your information (pursuant to the mechanism set forth in “Updating your personal information and privacy preferences”) that is mandatory, you will no longer be able to engage in that particular activity.</p>
                <p>When you use the Site and the Products and Services, OCREX may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site and the Products and Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer.</p>
                <p>OCREX also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services. We do not match such information with personal information held about you by OCREX unless we have your consent, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>By using this Site and the Products and Services, you agree and acknowledge that personal information collected through the Site or in connection with the Products and Services may be transferred across national boundaries and be processed in any of the countries around the world in which OCREX maintains offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted third party vendors or agents of OCREX such as credit card processors, web hosting providers, mail and email service providers, communication services, and web analytic providers, to help facilitate OCREX in providing certain functions. Another instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible, and the pages are hosted for OCREX by such third party vendors. For example, on the sign up pages for some newsletters, the pages may be hosted by a third party vendor, but appear to be autoentry.com pages and they are therefore governed by this Privacy Policy. Personal information may be shared with these providers to fulfil the service. Such third parties are bound by contract with OCREX not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p>
                <p>In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, prevent fraud and prevent abuse of our Site and the Products and Services, as well as to provide more consistent, relevant experiences to our users, we may on occasion supplement or correct the personal information you submit to us and your Internet Protocol (IP) address with information in our other databases or information from third-party sources.The Site and the Products and Services are intended for adult audiences, and OCREX does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
                <h3>Changes in Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>All personal information (“personal information” is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. OCREX may change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice of all changes in the Privacy Policy through indications on this Privacy Policy and in the footer of the web pages with authorized links to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>If as the result of such changes you want to alter the ways in which OCREX is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled “Updating your personal information and privacy preferences.” You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to OCREX you limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by OCREX or by third parties, OCREX will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent.</p>
                <p>However, if OCREX sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or OCREX (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with another entity, you agree that OCREX may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without obtaining your further consent. OCREX will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or mergers on this Site.</p>
                <h3>Entities collecting personal information</h3>
                <p>Personal information on this Site is collected by OCREX Ltd, who is responsible for this Site. OCREX Limited’s address is 76 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, D02 NY76, Ireland, and its telephone number is +353 1902 2618. The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information.</p>
                <h3>Updating your personal information and privacy preferences</h3>
                <p>You have the right to access, correct and delete inaccuracies in your personal information and privacy preferences at any time.

                <h3>How your personal information is used</h3>
                <p>OCREX collects your information in order to record, support and facilitate your participation in the activities you select and to prevent fraud and unlawful use. If you subscribe to or register for Products and Services, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.</p>
                <p>As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information may also be used to track customer preferences to provide a customized Site experience and keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of OCREX and selected Providers unless you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications are prohibited by law.</p>
                <p>OCREX does not share personal information it receives from visitors with such Providers for the Providers’ own marketing purposes unless OCREX has received an opt-in from you.</p>
                <p>OCREX may collect information about the use of the Products and Services and the Site, such as frequency of use, types of Services used, how many documents you upload for processing.</p>
                <p>OCREX may also collect information about Site pages visited and the IP address of your computer. This information is generally collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually, although IP address and Session ID in relation to purchases and use of Services may be tracked as part of OCREX’s customer order review and fraud prevention efforts. Other exceptions to this, where an individual may be identified individually, are noted in this Privacy Policy or in additional privacy terms connected to a specific Product, Service or website.</p>
                <p>OCREX may use aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for improving the Site and the Products and Services, providing more relevant experiences to our customers and for statistical analysis. Certain Products and Services may require you to use the most current version of such Product and Service or are offered in conjunction with other Products and Services, which you may or may not have already downloaded.</p>
                <p>The Product and Service may automatically check to determine if you are using the most current version or have other Products and Services and through e-mail messages, pop-up boxes or similar mechanisms inform you if need to upgrade in order to use the Product and Service you have requested. During this process, an IP address identifying your computer and the Product and Service version may be sent to a Web server, but system profile information is not transmitted nor are cookies used to store information.</p>
                <h3>Personal Information collected from submitted documents</h3>
                <p>OCREX, through its autoentry.com site, provides a data capture service for Users requiring the capture of invoices and receipts data from images or from electronic PDF documents. To do this, OCREX provides a facility for Users to upload such documents in a secure manner using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Once this data is received, it is processed by OCREX using Optical Character Recognition technology. To verify 100% accuracy of data captured from User’s submitted documents, trained OCREX personnel may view the documents temporarily. Though not possible in every case, OCREX endeavours to redact all Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from these documents before any manual accuracy verification processing takes place such that Personally Identifiable Information is not unnecessarily made visible to OCREX employees. Processing of this data only ever performed by trained OCREX personnel and is never performed by or outsourced to, any third-parties.</p>
                <p>At any time, a User may login to their account and delete any or all documents previously submitted to the service. In this case, the data will be permanently immediately deleted from OCREX provided storage.</p>
                <h3>Your choices with respect to personal information</h3>
                <p>OCREX recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site and in connection with the Products and Services. OCREX will respect your legal rights regarding access to, and correction and deletion of, your personal information. OCREX may communicate information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from OCREX unless you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications are prohibited by law, although in such cases we may find it necessary to continue to communicate with you regarding your use of the Site and the Products and Services. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, OCREX will not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
                <p>There are other instances in which OCREX may divulge your personal information, such as when required by law, regulation, or litigation. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.</p>
                <h3>Protection of your personal information</h3>
                <p>The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or of the Products and Services is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.</p>
                <p>This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on secure servers that only selected OCREX personnel have access to via password. OCREX encrypts your personal information as it is transferred to OCREX and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information.</p>
                <p>Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on secure servers and is accessible only to selected OCREX personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible online by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.</p>
                <h3>Community Sites</h3>
                <p>Please note that any information you post to an OCREX hosted public bulletin board, to a blog or community help (the Community Sites) is available to all persons accessing that location, and your e- mail address and other personal information or content you upload may also be posted on these Community Sites. The information you share, including your email address, would then be available to all persons accessing these Community Sites, and such information may be read, collected or used by others for any purpose, including sending you unsolicited messages.</p>
                <p>OCREX is not responsible for any information you elect to submit in these Community Sites or the use of such information. In addition, you should be aware that some Community Sites offer a service in which subscribers are e-mailed a copy of all messages posted to the Community Sites on a particular topic. Consequently, if you post a message to such Community Sites, your e-mail address will be sent to those subscribers who have indicated an interest in the topic of your message.

                <h3>Tracking, use of cookies, web beacons and similar devices</h3>
                <p>In order to improve our Products and Services and the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our vendors and agents may use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and similar devices to track your activities. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables OCREX to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used by which a Product and Service may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as the “Add Subscription” button is clicked. This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data. It is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an identification card, and does not store any data on your computer.</p>
                <p>While OCREX uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site and the Products and Services (such as the number of downloads, types of Products and Services used and downloaded, how many users we receive daily, the Site pages visited), and web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, OCREX does not generally use this information to identify you personally. Exceptions to this are noted in this Privacy Policy. If you expressly provide consent for the Site or the Product and Service to “remember” the unique identifier that you select when you register for various activities on the Site or the Products and Services, that unique identifier will be stored on a persistent cookie on your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Registration Information. As a result, your navigation path around the Site and the Products and Services will be tracked in identifiable form.</p>
                <p>OCREX may also collect data about your online activities on the Sites for use in providing content and advertising tailored to your interests; if this occurs, you will be able to choose whether or not to have your information collected for such purpose. Some Products and Services allow the tracking of access to or use of Products and Services by users, as opposed to OCREX. For example, certain Products and Services allow document authors to restrict access to documents, track access to or use of those documents, or involve communications and transmission of data over the Internet to verify the authenticity of documents, authors and recipients. In many cases, this type of tracking will be obvious to you as a user of the Products and Services, and in others, the software and services license or terms of use, pop-up boxes, or email messages will inform you of these features and your options, such as disabling options.</p>
                <p>Some Products and Services require activation, which tracks information including installation rights and number of installations.</p>
                <p>Personal Information that users provide about other individuals for tell-a-friend or other referral features on the Site or within Products and Services is used by OCREX to send an initial communication to the person whose details you have provided, and is not retained in OCREX’s systems. If you are invited by someone else to participate in shared editing or viewing of documents, photos, websites or other content, you will typically be required to contact the person who invited you to update, correct or delete the personal information they provided about you. In general, even though we may delete an account you hold with us in these types of shared editing or viewing areas, we may continue to retain information regarding your past actions with respect to content reviews or sharing initiated by others.</p>
                <p>We may also ask you to provide information of others such as when reporting suspected piracy. In this instance, we will ask for the person’s or company’s name and contact information so that we may investigate. Personal information supplied in these instances will only be used for the purpose being submitted.</p>
                <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and most Products and Services that include similar devices are typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or the related Products and Services.)</p>
                <p>Information about non-cookie tracking devices and their features, including disabling options, are contained in the information materials provided with such Products and Services or on Site pages relating to such Products and Services.</p>
                <p>OCREX also hires other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction (“third-party advertisement servers”). They do not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviours associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. OCREX may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Products and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies. Should you have any complaints about the practices of any of these companies you should contact support@ocrex.com.</p>
                <h3>Privacy complaints</h3>
                <p>OCREX takes its users’ privacy concerns seriously. If you believe that OCREX has not complied with this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, you may write to the OCREX Privacy Officer at the following address:</p>
                <p><strong>OCREX Limited Privacy Officer/Customer Information</strong>76 Merrion SquareDublin 2IrelandEmail: <a href="mailto:support@ocrex.com">support@ocrex.com</a></p>
                <p>In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the ways in which you believe that the Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your complaint promptly.</p>
                <p>If you provide OCREX with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that Providers may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), OCREX will endeavour to update your privacy preferences in OCREX’s records with the latest preference in a timely and accurate manner. Also, please note that OCREX is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of non-OCREX websites to which this Site or any other OCREX website may link. You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the sites.</p>
